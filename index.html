<h1>Year In Review</h1>
<p> For the last few years I've really wanted to track my "good" habits look at the data and see what I can learn from them. However, I would always burn out a few months into the process. This was the first year I was able to go a whole year tracking my habits. I used Daylio/Google fit to track my habits. Then imported the data into my own DB schema and plotted everything with ploty. </p>


<p>These are the 6 habits I tracked</p>
<h3>Knowledge</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Reading Note: This only includes physical books</li>
  <li>Programming Note: Does not include any programming for work</li>
  <li>Math Note: Lots of overlap with reading since I was reading books with math and was never quite sure how to categorize that activty. So this is just me with a pencial and paper figuring stuff out. It does not include watching math videos or reading math books</li>
</ul>

<h3>Health</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Running</li>
  <li>Yoga</li>
  <li>Weights</li>
</ul>

<h3>Meditation</h3>
