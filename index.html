<h1>Year In Review</h1>
<p> For the last few years I've really wanted to track my "good" habits look at the data and see what I can learn from them. However, I would always burn out a few months into the process. This was the first year I was able to go a whole year tracking my habits. I used Daylio/Google fit to track my habits. Then imported the data into my own DB schema and plotted everything with ploty. </p>


<p>I tracked 6 habits that can be broken down into 3 categories.</p>
<h3>Knowledge</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Reading</li>
  <li>Programming</li>
  <li>Math Note: Lots of overlap with reading since I was reading books with math and was never quite sure how to categorize that activty. So this is just me with a pencial and paper figuring stuff out. It does not include watching math videos or reading math books</li>
  <li> Does not include: Audio Books Reading - Educational videos (mostly math or ML) </li>
</ul>

<h3>Health</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Running</li>
  <li>Yoga</li>
  <li>Weights</li>
  <li>Does not include: Walks (2-3 for the dog) I did track this but it blows up the chart since I walk the dog almost every day</li>
</ul>

<h3>Meditation</h3>

<p>First an overview of how much I did each activity this year. You can click on the sections to see a better breakdown of that category. IE: Click Exercise in the chart</p>

<p>The values are calcuated by how many days I did that activity</p>
